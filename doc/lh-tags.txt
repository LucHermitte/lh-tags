PRESENTATION                            *lhtags-presentation* {{{1
lh-tags is a ctags wrapper plugin for Vim.

This plugin has two features:
 * The generation of `tags` files is simplified,
 * and tag selection is simplified (the support for overloads (when
   _overloading_ is supported) is more ergonomic than what |:tselect| permits)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES                                *lhtags-features* {{{1

TAGS GENERATION                         *lhtags-generation* {{{2
 * Is portable: the plugin is regularly used on nixes, windows (with or without
   cygwin, and with |'shellslash'| on).
 * Is incremental: when a file under the watch of lh-tags is modified, only
   this file is parsed -- its previous information is deleted from the current
   `tags` file.
 * Can be run on the whole project, when needed
 * Is, of course, parametrisable (see |lhtags-options|).
 * Can be run asynchronously (this is the default starting from Vim 7.4-1980).
   When this happens, |airline| <https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline>
   will display information about the background jobs.
 * Can be done on a third-party project freshly cloned/checked out without a
   need to define any configuration file for |local_vimrc|.
 * Doesn't have external dependencies other than `ctags` and `cd`.
   BTW, I highly recommend [universal ctags](http://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags)
   over exhuberant ctags.
 * Is project friendly: i.e. multiple projects can be opened simultaneously in
   a vim session, and we can run `ctags` on each of them with different
   specialized options to produced dedicaded tag files.
 * Tag files built can be used to (automatically) fill 'spellfile' option with
   words to be ignored by vim spell checker.

TAGS SELECTION                          *lhtags-selection* {{{2
 * Presents all tags that match the selected text (`META-W-META-DOWN`), or the
   pattern used (|:LHTags|).
 * Can hide, or show, functions signatures (on `s`).
 * Permits to sort the results by `K`ind, `N`ame, or `F`ilename.
 * Can filter the results on any (ctags) field (_kind_, _name_, _filename_,
   _signature_, _namespace_, ...)
 * The selected tag can be jumped to in the current window (`CR`,
   _double-click_), or in a split window (`o`) -- the tags stack is updated
   along the way.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE                                   *lhtags-usage* {{{1

In order to use lh-tags, I highly recommend to use a plugin like
[local_vimrc](http://github.com/LucHermitte/local_vimrc).

In the buffer local section, you'll have to:
 * adjust |(bg):tags_options.{ft}.flags| if the default values don't suit you
 -- I used to add exclusion lists in my projects.
 * to be sure where the root directory of the source files is:
   * either set |b:tags_dirname|, or |b:project_sources_dir|, or
     |BTW_project_config._.paths.sources| to the project root directory --
     when my projects are compiled with CMake+whatever I use the variables
     from CMake encapsulation of
     [BuildToolsWrapper](http://github.com/LucHermitte/vim-build-tools-wrapper)
     to set |b:tags_dirname|.
   * or be sure there is a `.git/` or a `.svn/` subdirectory in the root
     directory of the source code.

Then, you'll have to generate the `tags` database once (`<C-X>ta`), then you
can enjoy lh-tag automagic update of the database, and improved tag selection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONS                                 *lhtags-options* {{{1

 * *b:tags_dirname* defaults to an empty string for the current directory;
   you'll have to set this option to the root of your project.
   If you leave it unset, it will be set on first tags generation to (in
   order):
   - |b:project_sources_dir|, which is used by some of |mu-template| templates ;
   - or `(bg):BTW_project_config._.paths.sources`, which is used by
     |BuildToolsWrapper| to define project settings
   - or where `.git/` is found in parent directories ;
   - or where `.svn/` is found in parent directories ;
   - or asked to the end-user (previous values are recorded in case several
     files from a same project are opened).
 * *lh#tags#add_indexed_ft()*
   Manages the filetypes whose files will be indexed. Other files are ignored.
   This sets the local option *b:tags_options.indexed_ft* -- prefer this
   function when using |local_vimrc| to configure project.
   It's also possible to set the global option *b:tags_options.indexed_ft*
   that'll be used instead. It's meant to be used when no project are defined.  >
     :call lh#tags#add_indexed_ft('c', 'cpp')
< * *lh#tags#set_lang_map()*
   Manages the extensions associated to a filetype. You could directly set
   `b:tags_options.{ft}.langmap` to `--langmap=C++:+.txx` or `--map-C++=+.txx`,
   the point is this tool function helps to set the option to the best
   possible value according to the current `ctags` flavour (etags or utags). >
     :call lh#tags#set_lang_map('cpp', '+.txx')
< * *(bg):tags_options.flags* defaults to an empty string; It contains extra
   flags you could pass to `ctags` execution. You'll have to adjust
   these options to your needs.
   Warning: This was renamed from *(bg):tags_options* in version 2.0.0.
 * *(bg):tags_options.{ft}.flags* defaults to:
    * c:    `'--c++-kinds=+p --fields=+imaS --extra=+q'`
    * cpp:  `'--c++-kinds=+pf --fields=+imaSft --extra=+q --language-force=C++'`
            `'x{c++.properties}` will also be added when using Universal ctags
    * java: `'--c++-kinds=+acefgimp --fields=+imaSft --extra=+q --language-force=Java'`
    * vim:  `'--fields=+mS --extra=+q'`
   Warning: This was renamed from *(bg):tags_options_{ft}* in version 2.0.0.
 * *(bg):tags_filename* defaults to `'tags'`; in case you want your `tags` file
   to have another name.
 * *(bg):tags_executable* defaults to `ctags`; you should not need to change
   it.
 * *(bg):tags_must_go_recursive* defaults to 1; set it to 0 if you really want
   to not explore subdirectories.
 * *(bg):tags_select* defaults to `'expand('<cword>')'`; this policy says how
   the current word under the cursor is selected by normal mode mapping
   |<M-W><M-Down>|
 * *(bg):tags_options.no_auto* defaults to 1; set it to 0 if you want to enable the
   automatic incremental update.
   Warning: this has changed in version 2.0.0; it used to be named
   *(bg):LHT_no_auto* , and to have the opposite default value.
 * *lh#tags#ignore_spelling()* option permits to add all the current tags to
   Vim spellchecker ignore list. If no parameter is passed to the function, it
   will assume the dictionary file to be named `code-symbols-spell.{enc}.add`.
   If no file was specified in 'spellfile', one is automatically added to
   contain words the end-user would want to manually register with |zg| and
   all.
 * *(bg):tags_to_spellfile* has been deprecated. See |lh#tags#ignore_spelling()| instead.
 * *g:tags_options.auto_spellfile_update* specifies whether spellfiles are
   automatically generated from updated tag files:
   - `0`    : never, use *CTRL-X_ts* instead.
   - `1`    : always
   - `"all"`: only when tags are regenerated forthe whole project, never when
            a file is saved.
   Indeed, updating spellfile may be very long on some projects, and we may
   not wish to see this task automated.
 * *g:tags_options.run_in_bg* ; set to 1 by default, if |+job|s are supported.
   Tells to execute |<Plug>CTagsUpdateCurrent| and |<Plug>CTagsUpdateAll| in
   background (through |+job| feature).
   This option is best set in your |.vimrc|. If you want to change or toggle
   its value, you'd best use the |menu| Project->Tags->Generate when running
   |gvim|, or the |:Toggle| command: >
     :Toggle ProjectTagsGenerate
< * *lh#tags#update_tagfiles()* instructs the plugin to automatically set
   'tags' with the current tagfile.
   This may be deprecated in the future for something less cumbersome to use.


A typical configuration file for |local_vimrc| will be:  *lhtags+localvimrc*  >
    " #### In _vimrc_local.vim
    " Local vimrc variable for source dir
    let b:project_sources_dir = g:FooBarProject_config.paths.sources
    " or
    LetIfUndef b:BTW_project_config._ = g:FooBarProject_config
    ...
    " ======================[ tags generation {{{2
    " Be sure tags are automatically updated on the current file
    LetIfUndef b:tags_options.no_auto 0
    " Declare the indexed filetypes
    call lh#tags#add_indexed_ft('c', 'cpp')
    " Update Vim &tags option w/ the tag file produced for the current project
    " (the folowing line is the only one which is required in all projects)
    call lh#tags#update_tagfiles() " uses b:project_sources_dir/BTW_project_config
    " Register ITK/OTB extensions as C++ extensions
    call lh#tags#set_lang_map('cpp', '+.txx')
    " Instruct to ignore spelling of code constructs
    call lh#tags#ignore_spelling()
    " But automatically when a file has been saved (this is too slow on OTB!)
    LetIfUndef g:tags_options.auto_spellfile_update 'all'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAPPINGS AND COMMANDS                   *lhtag-mappings* {{{1

 * The tags for the current file can be explicitly updated with *CTRL-X_tc* --
   this mappings defaults to *<Plug>CTagsUpdateCurrent*
 * All the tags for the current project can be explicitly updated with
   *CTRL-X_ta* -- this mappings defaults to *<Plug>CTagsUpdateAll*
 * The list of words to ignore with the spellchecker can be updated on demand
   with *CTRL-X_ts* -- bound by default to *<Plug>CTagsUpdateSpell*
   This requires |lh#tags#ignore_spelling()| to have been explicitly |call|ed.
   Otherwise nothing will be done.
 * Tags matching the current word (or selection) will be presented on
   *<C-W><M-Down>* -- these two mappings default to *<Plug>CTagsSplitOpen*

 * We can also present the tags that match a pattern with *:LHTags* command
   (this command supports auto-completion on tag names)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TO DO                                   *lhtags-todo* {{{1

 * Have behaviour similar to the one from the quickfix mode (possibility to
   close and reopen the search window; prev&next moves)
 * Show/hide declarations -- merge declaration and definitions
 * Pluggable filters (that will check the number of parameters, their type, etc)
 * Check on-the-fly generation
 * Get rid of |lh#tags#update_tagfiles()| is possible.
 * Be able to specify a directory to store all spellfiles automatically.
   `{prjroot}/spell/`, `{prjroot}/.spell/`?
 * |g:tags_options.auto_spellfile_update| should be overridable for each
 project.
 * See to update spellfile in the background thanks to Python.
 * Auto-highlight tags >
     :let names = lh#tags#getnames(tagsfile)
     " C++ expr
     :let ids = filter(copy(names), 'v:val =~ "\\v([: ]|operator)"')
     " But the following is still slow
     :let [ma,t] = lh#time#bench(function('map'), copy(ids), 'matchadd("MyGroup", "\\V\\<".v:val)."\\>"')
     " As well as
     "   :let r = '\V\<\('.join(ids, '\|').'\)\>'
     "   :let m = matchadd('MyGroup', r)
     " And navigating the code is slow as hell as well.
     " Beside quite everything could get highlighted. What isn't an identifier from
     " somewhere ?
     :call map(ma, 'matchdelete(v:val)) " to clear up the mess

     " However the following is fast and doesn't impact performances
     :let ids = filter(copy(names), 'v:val =~ "\\v^\\k+$"')
     :let [ma,t] = lh#time#bench(function('map'), copy(ids), 'execute("syn keyword MyGroup ".v:val)')

<   This is slow on my code bases with up 30k unique tag remaining after
   clearing `::` and C++ `operators.`
 * Auto-update on other events like |CursorHold|
 * Document API:
   * *lh#tags#getnames()*
   * *lh#tags#command()*
   * *lh#tags#cmd_line()*
